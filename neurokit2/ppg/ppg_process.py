def ppg_process(ppg_signal, sampling_rate=1000, **kwargs):
    """**Process a photoplethysmogram (PPG)  signal**

    Convenience function that automatically processes a photoplethysmogram signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ppg_signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The raw PPG channel.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of :func:`.emg_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as :func:`.emg_signal` containing the following columns:

        * ``"PPG_Raw"``: the raw signal.
        * ``"PPG_Clean"``: the cleaned signal.
        * ``"PPG_Rate"``: the heart rate as measured based on PPG peaks.
        * ``"PPG_Peaks"``: the PPG peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.

    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the information of peaks and the signals' sampling rate.
